* added class to h2 tag in sections to be more specific in css

* added classes to h tags so that even if the h number changes don't have to change css, stylings stay the same

* add child selector given to #benefits div and main section so that only direct divs will get the styling and be applied if another section/div added

* added class just for benefits images to distinguish it from other images such as section images
